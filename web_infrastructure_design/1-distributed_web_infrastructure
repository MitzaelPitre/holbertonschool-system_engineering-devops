Whiteboard Explanation

Okay, let's start with the infrastructure design. We have a three-server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com. We added two more servers to the original design to improve scalability and availability.

Load Balancer (HAproxy)

We added a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers. This way, if one server is busy or goes down, the other servers can take over.

Additional Servers

We added two more servers to increase capacity and reduce the load on individual servers. This makes our infrastructure more resilient to high traffic and failures.

Database Primary-Replica Cluster

We set up a database Primary-Replica cluster to ensure data consistency and high availability. The Primary node (Master) accepts writes and updates, while the Replica node (Slave) is a read-only copy that's updated in real-time.

Why did we add a load balancer?

We added a load balancer to distribute traffic and improve scalability and availability.

What algorithm does the load balancer use?
The load balancer uses a Round-Robin algorithm.

What's the difference between Active-Active and Active-Passive setup?

Active-Active means both servers are active and receive traffic, while Active-Passive means one server is active and the other is passive and only takes over in case of failure.

How does the database Primary-Replica cluster work?

The Primary node accepts writes and updates, while the Replica node is a read-only copy that's updated in real-time.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

Where are the Single Points of Failure (SPOF)?

The load balancer and the Primary node are SPOF, as if they fail, the entire infrastructure becomes unavailable.

What security issues do we have?

We don't have a firewall, so we're vulnerable to external attacks, and we don't have HTTPS, so data is not encrypted.

What's missing from our infrastructure?

We don't have monitoring in place to detect issues with the infrastructure, so we might not notice problems until it's too late.
