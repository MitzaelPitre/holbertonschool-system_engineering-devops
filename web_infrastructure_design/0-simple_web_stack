A simple explanation of the one server web infrastructure:

1. User wants to access the website

A user types www.foobar.com in their web browser and presses Enter.

2. DNS Resolution

The user's computer sends a request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name www.foobar.com to an IP address. The DNS server responds with the IP address 8.8.8.8, which is the IP address of our server.

3. Server Receives Request

The user's web browser sends a request to our server at IP address 8.8.8.8. Our server is running Nginx web server, which receives the request.

3. Nginx Forwards Request

Nginx forwards the request to our application server, which is running on the same server.

4. Application Server Processes Request

Our application server processes the request and retrieves the necessary data from our MySQL database.

5. Database Retrieves Data

Our MySQL database retrieves the requested data and sends it back to the application server.

6. Application Server Sends Response

Our application server sends the response back to Nginx, which then sends it back to the user's web browser.

7. User Sees Website

The user sees the website www.foobar.com in their web browser.

That's the web infrastructure that hosts a website and serve like example in the whiteboard image. Now the problem with this infrastructure is:

1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF)

The single server is a SPOF, meaning that if it goes down, the entire website is unavailable. This can happen due to hardware failure, software issues, or other reasons.

2. Downtime during Maintenance

When maintenance is needed, such as deploying new code, the web server needs to be restarted. This can cause downtime for the website, which can be frustrating for users.

3. Cannot Scale with High Traffic

The single server cannot handle a large amount of incoming traffic. If the website becomes very popular, the server may become overwhelmed, leading to slow response times or even crashes. This can result in a poor user experience and lost business.
